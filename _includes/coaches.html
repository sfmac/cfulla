            "I have been involved with CrossFit for 4 years now and loved every minute. CrossFit gives you a level of fitness and a sense of accomplishment like nothing I have ever done before. From the very first class I knew it was going to change my life but I
            had no idea just how much. Before I knew it I was hitting goals I never thought possible for a 31 year old mother of 2, and it didn't stop there. I had wonderful support from experienced trainers and they pushed me to be the best I could be.
            I started to compete at an intermediate level and then advanced and before I knew it CrossFit had become my life. I studied and passed my trainer certificate but I learned to be a coach from people that will always mean the world to me and
            now it's my turn to inspire others to be the best they can be - always better than yesterday."</blockquote>
